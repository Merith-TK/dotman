Merith-TK: alright lets plan out a dotfiles manager in golang, its name is `dotman`, its meant to create a `.dotman` folder in the users `home`, this folder will hold the local git repo of the dotfiles. 

the intended use is i can do `dotman add .config/sway`, and it moves `.config/sway` to `.dotman/.config/sway` and then symlinks it back to its original location. so the *hard files* are in the git repo, while the configs that are read are in the original locations. 

this is meant to allow an easier way to track and manage dotfiles without the files being spread around. It is meant to support folders and individual files being synced. 

an index file in the root of the repo for dotman to "deploy" from will likely be best suited, 

this project is in golang.

use .copilot/ to keep a running notes file, as well as other files for your own personal reference so as to avoid token rot

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you plan out the `dotman` dotfiles manager in Go. Let me first explore the current workspace structure and then create a comprehensive plan. Perfect! Starting with a fresh Go project. Let me create the project structure and planning documents.

Now let me create the basic Go project structure: Great! The Go module already exists. Let me create the project structure: Now let's create the core types and structures:

Now let's test the build: I need to fix the method definitions. In Go, you can't define methods on types from other packages. Let me fix this: 

Continue to iterate?
Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

Now let's try building again: Excellent! The build succeeded. Let's test the basic functionality: Perfect! Let's test the status command: Great! Now let's create a test file and add it to test the full workflow:
