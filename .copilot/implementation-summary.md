# Dotman Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete dotfiles manager in Go with the following capabilities:

## Implemented Features

### Core Commands
- ✅ `dotman init` - Initialize new dotman repository
- ✅ `dotman clone <url>` - Clone existing dotfiles repository  
- ✅ `dotman add <path>` - Add files/directories to management
- ✅ `dotman remove <path>` - Remove files from management
- ✅ `dotman status` - Show managed files status
- ✅ `dotman deploy` - Deploy all managed files
- ✅ `dotman fix [path]` - Fix broken or missing symlinks

### Security Features
- ✅ **HOME Directory Only**: All operations restricted to user's home directory
- ✅ **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal and external access
- ✅ **Symlink Verification**: Validates symlinks during status checks
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with actionable feedback

### Implementation Details
- ✅ **Git Integration**: Automatic repository initialization and commits
- ✅ **Index Management**: JSON-based tracking of managed files
- ✅ **File Operations**: Safe move, symlink, and restore operations
- ✅ **CLI Framework**: Cobra-based command-line interface
- ✅ **Go Modules**: Proper package structure and dependencies

## Testing Results

### Successful Tests
1. **Build Process**: Compiles without errors
2. **CLI Help**: All commands appear with proper descriptions
3. **Repository Initialization**: Creates `.dotman` with git repo
4. **Security Validation**: Rejects files outside HOME directory
5. **File Management**: Successfully adds/removes files with symlinks
6. **Content Preservation**: File contents maintained through operations
7. **Status Reporting**: Accurate status display of managed files

### Example Workflow
```bash
# Initialize repository
dotman init
# → Initialized dotman repository in ~/.dotman

# Add a configuration file
dotman add ~/.bashrc
# → Successfully added ~/.bashrc to dotman management

# Check status
dotman status
# → ✓ ~/.bashrc (file) - OK

# Remove from management
dotman remove ~/.bashrc
# → Successfully removed ~/.bashrc from dotman management
```

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Security First
- All operations must be within HOME directory
- Path validation at entry points
- Clear error messages for security violations

### 2. Function-Based API
- Used functions instead of methods to avoid Go's restrictions
- Clean separation of concerns between packages
- Easy to test and maintain

### 3. Git Integration
- Automatic initialization and commits
- Descriptive commit messages
- Repository validation for clone operations

### 4. Symlink Strategy
- Move files to repository first
- Create symlinks to maintain original locations
- Validate symlinks during status checks

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- All implementation files in proper Go project structure
- Comprehensive documentation and planning files
- Working CLI application with full feature set

### Documentation
- README.md with user guide and examples
- Command specifications with detailed behavior
- Implementation notes with progress tracking
- Planning documents with architecture decisions

## Ready for Use
The dotman implementation is complete and ready for:
- Personal use managing dotfiles
- Extension with additional features
- Distribution to other users
- Integration into development workflows

All core requirements have been met with proper error handling, security validation, and user-friendly interface.
